### Pricing

- The 3P’s i.e. Product, Place (Channel) and Promotion determine the customer’s perception of value in a competitive context, determining the max price for the customer
- Effective pricing is about capture of some of the customer value to fund itself
- Pricing Basis and Objective:
  - Cost act as floor on pricing. You can sell at a loss initially to gain share but hard to increase prices at a later stage as earlier price act as reference point
  - Value varies across customers. Hence higher price, lower sales and vice versa.
    - Skim Pricing: Charging high initially and reducing the price at a later stage
    - Penetration: Lower price since start to drive high sales. You lose some profit from certain customers but you avoid competition. Works best when
      - Customers are price sensitive
      - Economies of scale is needed
      - availability of capacity
      - high competitive threat
- Each customer may place different value so you can customise price within legal constraints. You can do so by
  - Develop product line i.e. soft and hard cover of a book
  - limited availability of lower price or time bound of such prices
  - Vary basis observable customer characteristics
  - Vary basis volume
- Price is dependent on how competition react. Price ware are high when
  - High fixed but low variable cost
  - Little differentiation among competition
  - slow growth
  - Economies of scale is important
