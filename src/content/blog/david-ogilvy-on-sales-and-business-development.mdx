**David Mackenzie Ogilvy** who was a British advertising tycoon and founded [Ogilvy & Mather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogilvy_%26_Mather). He is regarded as the "Father of Advertising" across multiple business circles. He was one of the pioneers of utilising meticulous research into consumer habits for developing his campaigns.

In a recent article, I came across his philosophy toward Sales and Business Development, which I found is practical for most of us learning the ropes of Sales as we go along building our Business.

## Business Development Advise

- Regard the hunt for a new client as a sport
  - Get Serious after you get a client. Till then play to win but focus to make it an enjoyable process
- Never work for a client so big that you can’t afford to lose them
  - You can never provide them with candid advise and you will become a lackey
  - Land your idea client when you ready to be candid with them
- Take immense pain in selecting your client
  - First class people are not in high supply. Always retain power to choose with whom you wish to work
- Add Limited Clients yearly
  - Clients need to be with you for life
  - Fast growth results in low quality training of staff, resulting in best people focussed on serving new clients and losing older ones
- Only Seek clients with a product or service you are proud of. If You have your product or services, you will never help your customers to succeed
- Only focus to work with someone you can add value and improve their work in your field of service
- Don’t take on clients whose business is dying. The customer success defines you and your margins wont be able to handle non-payment
- Only work for clients who want you to make a profit. Clarify to your customers that you are planning to take a certain % of their profit. State clearly that make money only by helping them make money
- Never make public statement that you are pursuing someone. Succeed in public but fail in private
- Avoid contesting for a customer when there are more than 4 players. Lot of time is wasted in meetings
- Getting a new customer is solo performance. Singularity is important in winning accounts
- Remain flexible when selling your solutions. Never go with a fixed Mindset
- Clearly state your flaws to your prospects. This develops trust and allows you to develop credibility when you boast strong points about your solutions
- Don’t get bogged down in case-studies or research. Focus on your clients and talk about them
- Explicitly tell when they should hire you
- Never engage outside source commission for leads. Such leads are not worth the trouble
- Beware of those who have great idea but no budget. Very few such companies make it to the top and generally not worth the effort
- Never underestimate personality. Very few difference exists between firms. In the end persona of the person leading wins or loses the deals
- Fire clients 5 times more than they fire you. If client behaviour erodes morale, walk away
- Use your own specialisation to find new clients. Show world how good you are
