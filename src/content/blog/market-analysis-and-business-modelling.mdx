## Introduction

I recently gave a presentation to multiple startup founders on Market Analysis and Business Modelling, covering a wide range of topics that any new business or startup founder can find value.

I hope to create a series of posts on each of these topics to allow for more understanding on the topics explained in the presentation

You can open the speaker notes to find more indepth explaination on the topic within the slide.
